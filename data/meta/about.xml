                    <p> Aratea Digital is a database collecting information about astronomy in the
                        Early Middle Ages. The main focus of the project is the Latin transmission
                        of the so-called Aratea texts including the Latin translations and the
                        derivative texts based on Aratus' didactic poem Phaenomena. The website
                        presents descriptions of their (pre-13th-century) manuscripts, references to
                        the latest editions and relevant literature. </p>
                    <p> This website is work-in-progress. We are constantly working on improving and
                        enhancing the information provided. </p>

                        <item>Summary introduction of the Aratea texts, providing basic information
                            on their history, as well as the authoritative edition, relevant
                            literature and links to further resources. Also all manuscripts that
                            contain the respective text will be automatically listed here.</item>
                        <item>Description of all pre
                            13th-century manuscripts of the Aratea texts.</item>
                        <item>Indices for all places and people connected with the manuscript
                            transmission of the Aratea, as well as other text, which build up their Überlieferungsgemeinschaft. We aim
                            to link all entities with Authority files (<ref target="http://www.dnb.de/DE/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html">GND</ref> and <ref target="http://www.geonames.org/">geonames</ref>) to
                            facilitate identification and future interoperability.</item>

                    <p> The manuscript descriptions are encoded using the guidelines of the <ref
                            target="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</ref>, which
                        is an XML standard widely adopted in the digital humanities for the
                        representation of texts. </p>
                    <p> To validate the mark-up we used the TEI P5 schema for <ref
                            target="http://www.europeanaregia.eu/">Europeana Regia</ref> (ER). The
                        practices from the <ref target="http://www.hab.de/">Herzog August library
                            Wolfenbüttel</ref> were taken as an example for structuring the manuscript
                        descriptions. People, places are texts (works within manuscripts) are tagged
                        as such and gathered in indices together with additional information as well
                        as links to further resources. The XML files are also available for
                        download. </p>
                    <p> With the growing number of manuscript description being added to the
                        database we are further working on different possibilities to search, filter
                        and analyse the data. Apart from full text search we plan to integrate
                        faceted search to filter the manuscripts according to certain criteria
                        (shelfmark, origin place / time, texts etc.) and possibly to combine
                        different criteria. </p>
