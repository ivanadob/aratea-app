            <p>Following to some extant Germanicus’ methodology, <rs type="person" ref="#avienus">Rufus Festus Avienus</rs> translated the poem once more into Latin in the 4th c. AD. It is the only Latin translation preserved in extenso that contains both the first and the second part of the poem. Avienus elaborated on the original work using <rs type="person" ref="#hipparchus">Hipparchus</rs>’ commentary and the <title>Catasterisms</title>. His style has been characterized as verbose which can be explained by the dominant literary tastes of his time and by the translator’s desire to say more than his model. In terms of figures, the 757 verses in Aratus’ first part correspond to 1383 verses in Avienus’. In the second part dealing with weather signs, however, the two versions are almost equal in size (422 verses and 553 verses respectively).</p>
               <p>In conclusion, <rs type="person" ref="#cicero">Cicero</rs>’s translation followed the Greek original closely and seems to have intended mainly to “translate” the Greek charm of the poem. Germanicus’ and Avienus’ translations were probably meant to be “scientifically” up-to-date and emended versions of the original. Apart from these extant translations, Jerome attested that Aratus’ poem was translated by many others “quos enumerare perlongum est.”3 There are two quotations extant from a translation by Ovid. Emma Gee explored the astronomical character of Ovid’s Fasti and argued that it is indebted to Aratus.</p>
